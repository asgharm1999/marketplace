We provided scrapped data from the following websites AptDeco, Craigslist, Etsy, UHaul (for shipping estimates if zipcode provided), and YellowPages with recommendations based on location, price, and size.

Users can view both new and second hand furniture and compare. Links will be provided if you chose to purchase. 

HOW TO RUN:

In command line:

Navigate to root directory of marketplace folder 
python3 __main__.py



Note that RealSimple data is collected via its API. You will need to get an API token and there will be a prompt to paste it in. You do not have to change any code or pip install anything. Our main file sets everything up. 




Pre-scraped CSV results are provided. You will be prompted if you want to use that or compile new data.

Here are the instructions to get the API token.


These are the capabilities of the app.

Input:

Enter a product you are interested in purchasing (e.g. couches, tables, chairs, etc.).
